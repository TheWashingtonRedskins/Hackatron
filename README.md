Hackatron is a works-everywhere ultra-portable social app for helping
others and getting help at hackathon events.

request help or help others with their projects.

  - [ ] Animations / "sexiness factor" pass
  - [ ] Video display via odroid / RPI
  - [ ] Competitive elements (leaderboard, etc)
  - [ ] Integration with devpost / SSO / project "Acknoledgements" list

Clean, minimalistic, easy to use. No page reloads. Responsive. Any size
screen.
