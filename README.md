Hackatron is a works-everywhere ultra-portable social app for helping
others and getting help at hackathon events.

Objectives / Tasks
=================

Our primary objective for the MHacks 6 hackathon is to build a
works-everywhere WebApp tailored for MHacks that allows anyone to
request help or help others with their projects.

Components (priority order):

  - [ ] Request help
  - [ ] View help requests
  - [ ] Respond to help request / request lifecycle
  - [ ] Store request history on an account / SSO
  - [ ] Point/reward system
  - [ ] Animations / "sexiness factor" pass
  - [ ] Video display via odroid / RPI
  - [ ] Competitive elements (leaderboard, etc)
  - [ ] Integration with devpost / SSO / project "Acknoledgements" list
  - [ ] Testing

UI Design Goals
===============

Clean, minimalistic, easy to use. No page reloads. Responsive. Any size
screen.
